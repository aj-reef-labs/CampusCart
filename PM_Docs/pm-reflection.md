# PM - Reflection (AJ Matise)

# How did you come up with your idea?

I came up with my idea because I actually had this problem while I was living in college dorms. I always found it super frustrating living with a lot of people—we all had to buy groceries, and we’d often double-buy things or forget items at the store. There just wasn’t an easy way to manage everything in one place. I think it could have been done a lot better.

I believe the best projects are the ones that come from your own problems—when you really understand the pain point and can build a product around it. That’s how this started: I wanted to solve the issue of multiple people needing a unified shopping list. Later, we added different features like budget splitting and others, but that core idea is what sparked everything.

# How well did the collaboration with your developer work?

Collaboration with Sol was awesome. She and I met in person at the library to go over the code and play around with examples. I think meeting in person helped a lot because we could communicate more easily. It was easier for me to express my ideas by showing her things on the website and just being there in person. That in-person connection was one of the key benefits of our teamwork.

We also communicated over Slack and Instagram. We were both super busy, but we tried to be as communicative as possible. Overall, I think we worked really well together. Because we met in person, we could easily communicate ideas between the PM and the developer and translate from business use cases to technical implementation.

# What did you learn about writing requirements?

When it came to writing requirements, I learned that while you can write a lot of documentation, wireframes are also incredibly useful. They can convey a lot more than just a written description. That’s why I tried to include more wireframes than required, to give Sol the best possible guidance on the project.

When writing requirements, it’s important to think about the site from the user’s perspective—how the user will interact with it. Writing from that point of view helps communicate your core ideas and how the program should function. It’s also crucial to be clear, specific, and structured rather than just writing long paragraphs. That might seem basic, but it really makes a big difference.

# Did you use any AI tools in this process? How?

Using ChatGPT’s new image generation tool to create wireframes was incredibly helpful. It was accurate and saved a lot of time. I also used ChatGPT to generate about a hundred different ideas. When I saw the one about a grocery list, I thought, “Okay, this is a cool idea,” and then added my own spin based on my real-life college experience.

I took that base idea of an online grocery shopping tracker and molded it into something that addressed a specific need on college campuses. I also used AI to bounce ideas around by asking different questions. I even asked it to ask me clarifying questions, which helped guide my decision-making. For example, it prompted me to consider different pages that I hadn’t thought of before, which was super useful.

Overall, AI was a big help in creating the project proposal and shaping the overall direction.
