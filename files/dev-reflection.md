## How did you interpret and implement someone elseâ€™s idea?

Interpreting and implementing an idea that is not your own is tricky because you want to be able to capture it as well as you can. It was really helpful when AJ and I got to meet and I got to understand his vision. Overall, our development process consisted in completing a certain goal and texting each other about it, to make sure that we were both on the same page.

## What were the challenges in development and collaboration?

The main challenge in development and collaboration is that as a developer, you might be making changes that the pm then asks you to redo or improve. Therefore, it can be a time consuming process. Nevertheless, AJ was a really supportive pm that provided helpful insight all throughout the project.

## Which parts did you use AI tools for, and what did you learn from that?

I mainly used AI for the JavaScript because it is the trickiest topic for me. I also used AI to debug, especially when I was trying to make all of the pages follow a similar aesthetic but could not figure out how to do so (for example, while some css worked for one page, the same css did format did not work for the other file). Overall, AI helped develop more complex code that required JavaScript.
